Nori_Crying-Hidden: ...
Luce: ...
Pause.
Luce_Look-Down: ... 
Luce: ...
Luce gives her a little poke.
Nori_Crying-Hidden: Don’t touch me.
Luce: ...
Luce: ...
It begins raining.
Nori_Crying-Hidden: Great...
Nori_Crying-Hidden: *sigh*
Luce: ...
Luce channels a light, slowly building its’ shape into an umbrella.
Luce holds the umbrella above her head.
Nori_Crying-Oh: Woah!
Nori_Crying-Side-Lip: How did you...
Nori_Crying-Side-Lip: ... do that?
Nori_Crying-Side-Lip: ...
Nori_Hidden-Visible-Crying-Side-Lip: ...
Luce: ... 
Pause.
Luce: ... Take it.
Nori_Hidden-Visible-Crying: ...
Nori wipes her tears, before grabbing the umbrella.
Nori_Look-Right-Sad: ...
Luce_Look-Down: ...
Quietness fills the air.
Luce: Are you... ok? 
Nori_Look-Down-Oh: I’m, um... 
Nori_Look-Left-Sad: I’m ok...
Luce: ...
Nori_Look-Left-Sad: ...
Quietness fills the air.
Luce: ... I like your shirt.
Nori_Look-Left-Sad: ...
Nori: ...
Nori: ...
Nori: Thanks...
Nori: I, um...
Nori: I like your shirt too. Or cloak I mean.
Luce: !
Nori: Do you... wear that around a lot?
Luce: *nods*
Nori: Huh. You’re not from around here then.
Luce: How can you tell?
Nori: I mean, it’s not hard to notice you.
Luce: ...
Nori: ...
Nori: Where are you from, exactly?
Luce: ... I am... on a secret mission. 
Luce: ...
Luce: I... cannot say.
Nori: What kind of mission?
Luce: ...
Nori: Oh... right. It’s a secret.
School bells are heard in the distance.
(shocked) Nori: Oh crap! I didn’t realise the time.
The little girl gets out of the seat.
Nori: Thanks for the umbrella. Here you go.
She offers the umbrella back to Luce.
Luce: ... Take it with you.
Nori: ... Oh.
Um... I’ll give it back if I find you again. You aren’t hard to miss.
See you around.
She leaves the playground, leaving Luce behind.
He sits there alone.
A firefly comes out of him and floats around. He places his finger high, and the firefly lands on it.
Luce: I... hesitated.
Luce: ... Why?
Little whirls are heard from the firefly. The light from it flickers as it talks.
Luce: I know. I should have done it when she was here.
Luce: And... I will do what I must.
He looks up to the sky, letting the rain soak him.
Luce: ...
Luce: But... 
Luce: It could wait just a little.
He sits on the swing set, and listens to the sounds of the environment.
A pause to take in the atmosphere.
Luce: These sounds...
Luce: I would not mind to sit here. To listen for a while.
Flashing images of a cricket chirping, a puddle rippling, the wind blowing on grass.
The winds whistle a little song. Something soothing, sounding like the tip taps of the rain, the soft breaths of the breeze.
(Option to save)
Luce gets up.
Luce: I wonder... if this is what life felt like. 
Luce: What do you think?
Little whirls are heard from the firefly.
Luce: You are getting wet. I am sorry.
Luce: You are right. We should find her again.
Luce: ...
The firefly flies back into Luce’s hood.
