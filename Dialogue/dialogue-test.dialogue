She leaves the playground, leaving Luce behind.
He sits there alone.
A firefly comes out of him and floats around. He places his finger high, and the firefly lands on it.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down look up")
Luce: [#look-up] I... hesitated.
Luce: [#look-up] ... Why?
Little whirls are heard from the firefly. The light from it flickers as it talks.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down look down")
Luce: [#close-eyes-down] I know. I should have done it when she was here.
Luce: [#close-eyes-down] And... I will do what I must.
He looks up to the sky, letting the rain soak him.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down look up")
Luce: [#look-up] ...
Luce: [#look-up] But... 
Luce: [#look-up] It could wait just a little.
He sits on the swing set, and listens to the sounds of the environment.
A pause to take in the atmosphere.
Luce: [#look-up] These sounds...
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down look down")
Luce: [#satisfaction] I would not mind to sit here. To listen for a while.
Flashing images of a cricket chirping, a puddle rippling, the wind blowing on grass.
The winds whistle a little song. Something soothing, sounding like the tip taps of the rain, the soft breaths of the breeze.
(Option to save)
Luce gets up.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down look right")
Luce: [#look-right] I wonder if this is what life felt like.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down")
Luce: [#default] What do you think?
Little whirls are heard from the firefly.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down look down")
Luce: [#close-eyes-down] You are getting wet. I am sorry.
do luce.PlayAnimation("sit down")
Luce: [#default] You are right. We should find her again.
Luce: [#default] ...
The firefly flies back into Luce’s hood.
=> END
